# Global-Business-Insights-360
As part of Data Analyst course curriculum through Codebasics, got to design this dashboard which provides insights into various departments in a company called AtliQ Hardware. 

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America. 
So, the senior executives of this company have decided to invest in a data analytics project by embedding a Power BI tool in the organisation.
This project is hoped to give answers to the questions of stakeholder in terms of all the aspects like finance, sales, marketing and supply chain.

## Steps followed in this project

1.	Project kick-off meeting where the Project Charter is used to describe and understand important dimensions of the project such as Project goals, Key Stakeholders, Hopes and fears, Risks, Timeline, etc.,
2.	Data collection and exploration –Collecting the data by referring to data catalog and having a good understanding of the available data and the business-related terms will help a lot in the analysis. 
3.	Importing data into Power BI - As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from MySQL database to Power Bi by providing the database access credential 
4.	Performing data transformation in Power Query – Creating date dimension table, calculated columns, merging the tables and validating the data against benchmark numbers
5.	Data Modelling and calculated columns using DAX – Connecting tables through one-one or one-many relationships and designing a correct data model is a very important part of the data analytics pipeline. Created various DAX measures based on the metrics provided that will eventually be used to build visuals.
6.	Designing an effective dashboard – Based on the mock ups received as requirement, designed the visuals and created measures as and when required.

## Technologies worked on

1.	SQL
2.	Excel
3.	Power BI desktop – DAX language, DAX studio for optimizing the report

## Project Outcome

Designed a multi-view dashboard in Power BI for 4 departments (sales, finance, supply chain and marketing) of AtliQ Hardware to understand sales trends and facilitate data-driven decisions, which aimed to scale the business processes by 10%.
Optimized the report using DAX studio, which improved performance by 5%.
